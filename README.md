# Overview

My goal for this project was to learn how to create a multi level program with several different files, functions, and graphics. I wanted to learn more about python and its possibilities through pygame. Additionally, I wanted to gain a better understanding of how games are created and how to break down the problems we face when creating a game. I also found a passion for designing levels, characters and story that I had not experienced before.

### Gameplay Instructions
#### Mission: Interact with the two totems (one in top-left, one in bottom-right of map) to fight the boss of the level.
